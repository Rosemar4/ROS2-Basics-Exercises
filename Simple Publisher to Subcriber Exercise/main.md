Of course. Let's start completely from scratch by creating a brand new, clean workspace for this project.

## Step 1: Create a New Workspace
A workspace is a dedicated folder that holds all your ROS2 projects. It's good practice to create a new one for a new set of tutorials.

Open your terminal.

Create a directory for your new workspace, including a src (source) folder inside it. The -p flag creates parent directories as needed.

Bash
```
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
```
Navigate into the root of your new workspace.

Bash
```
cd ~/ros2_ws
Initialize the workspace by running colcon build. Since there are no packages yet, this will just create the build, install, and log folders.
```
Bash
```
colcon build
You now have a clean, ready-to-use ROS2 workspace located at ~/ros2_ws.
```

## Step 2: Create Your Python Package
Now, inside your new workspace, we'll create the package that will hold our code.

Navigate into the src folder of your workspace:

Bash
```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
Create a new Python package named my_py_pkg:
```
Bash
```
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_py_pkg
Go into your new package's directory and create another folder with the same name. This is where your Python node files will live.
```
Bash
```
cd my_py_pkg
mkdir my_py_pkg
```
## Step 3: Write the Publisher Node ("talker.py")
This node will repeatedly publish a "hello world" message.

From the ~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg directory, create a new file:

Bash
```
touch my_py_pkg/talker.py
```
Open my_py_pkg/talker.py and copy the codes
