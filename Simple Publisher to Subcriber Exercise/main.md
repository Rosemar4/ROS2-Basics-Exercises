Of course. Let's start completely from scratch by creating a brand new, clean workspace for this project.

## Step 1: Create a New Workspace
A workspace is a dedicated folder that holds all your ROS2 projects. It's good practice to create a new one for a new set of tutorials.

Open your terminal.

Create a directory for your new workspace, including a src (source) folder inside it. The -p flag creates parent directories as needed.

Bash
```
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
```
Navigate into the root of your new workspace.

Bash
```
cd ~/ros2_ws
Initialize the workspace by running colcon build. Since there are no packages yet, this will just create the build, install, and log folders.
```
Bash
```
colcon build
You now have a clean, ready-to-use ROS2 workspace located at ~/ros2_ws.
```

## Step 2: Create Your Python Package
Now, inside your new workspace, we'll create the package that will hold our code.

Navigate into the src folder of your workspace:

Bash
```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
Create a new Python package named my_py_pkg:
```
Bash
```
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_py_pkg
Go into your new package's directory and create another folder with the same name. This is where your Python node files will live.
```
Bash
```
cd my_py_pkg
mkdir my_py_pkg
```
## Step 3: Write the Publisher Node ("talker.py")
This node will repeatedly publish a "hello world" message.

From the ~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg directory, create a new file:

Bash
```
touch my_py_pkg/talker.py
```
Open talker.py in this folder and copy the codes

##Step 4: Write the Subscriber Node ("listener.py")
This node will listen for the messages from the talker.
```
From the ~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg directory, create a second file:
```
Bash
```
touch my_py_pkg/listener.py
```

Open listener.py in this folder and copy the codes

Step 5: Configure the Package
Now, we tell ROS2 how to find and run our Python nodes.

Open the setup.py file located in ~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg.

Modify the entry_points dictionary to include your two nodes:

```Python

# Inside your setup.py file
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'talker = my_py_pkg.talker:main',
        'listener = my_py_pkg.listener:main',
    ],
},
```

## Step 6: Build and Run
Finally, let's build the package and run our nodes.

Build the package. Navigate back to the root of your workspace and build:

Bash
```
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select my_py_pkg
```
Source the workspace. In each new terminal you use, you must source the setup file from your new workspace:

Bash
```
source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```
Run the nodes. You will need two separate terminals for this.

In Terminal 1 (after sourcing), start the talker:

Bash
```
ros2 run my_py_pkg talker
```
In Terminal 2 (after sourcing), start the listener:

Bash
```
ros2 run my_py_pkg listener
```
You should now see the "Publishing..." messages in the first terminal and the "I heard..." messages in the second. You have successfully created a new workspace and your first publisher/subscriber pair!
